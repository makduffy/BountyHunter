This is a bounty hunter game programmed using Scala with a JUnit testing library. 

The game can be run on a shell script. 

Features:
The script simulates a 9x9 array, which populates it with walls and bounties. 
Player can enter words such as 'left' and 'down' to move across the grid.
When the Player tries to move to a (x,y) position containing a wall, it cannot enter that poosition on the grid.
When the Player tried to move to a (x,y) position containing a bounty, the player's score is increased.
Once the Player collects all bounties, the game is finished.
The Player can quit the game, which will result in displaying where the bounties where on the grid.
The player can also save their progress, and get their saved progress. 

The testing script features 50 tests that all successfully pass.
